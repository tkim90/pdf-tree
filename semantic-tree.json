  "title": "Smarsh Service Agreement - General Terms",
  "summary": "This document outlines the general terms and conditions governing the use of Smarsh's services by clients. It details the process of agreement acceptance, the structure of the service agreement, and the rights and responsibilities of both Smarsh and the client. Key sections cover service provision, support, trial services, client obligations, third-party providers, marketplace applications, and payment terms. The agreement emphasizes the client's responsibility for data security, compliance with laws, and payment of fees, while also disclaiming Smarsh's liability for third-party services and marketplace applications. The document serves as a binding contract that supersedes any prior agreements related to Smarsh services.",
